# CreditCardApprovalUsingDecisionTree
In this case study I worked as a data scientist for a bank that was looking to streamline the process of evaluating the credit worthiness of an applicant and identify the most important indicators of credit worthiness. To solve this problem I used Python pandas and the seaborn library to explore the data. Additionally, I used sklearn's decision tree, recursive feature elimination, and grid search cv modules to create and optimize the machine learning model. 

**Key Take Aways**:

* The key indicators for evaluating an applicant in this data set are: age, credit score, annual income, if they have a prior default, and if they are employed.

* The median age of approved applicants is 37.

* The approved applicant has a median credit score of 729.

* The approved applicant has a median annual income of 76K.

* A majority of approved applicants are employed and don't have a prior default.

* The trained, optimized model can predict if an applicant will be approved with an *82% accuracy*.  


**Business Applications:**

* **Process Improvement** - By streamlining the initial screening process through automated decision-making, the bank can process a higher volume of applications quickly and efficiently, while freeing up human resources to focus on more complex cases that require manual intervention.

* **Reduced Default Rates** - By minimizing the number of high-risk applicants approved, the bank can lower default rates and improved it's financial stability from interest revenue.
